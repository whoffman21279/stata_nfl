HOW TO GET .CSV FILE OF NFL SEASON DATA ONTO YOUR COMPUTER

1. Install R: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/

--Now that R is installed, everything else is for typing into R directly--

2. In R, install devtools and nflscraprR:
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github(repo = "maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR")
    
--You only need to do #1 and #2 once. Once they're done, in the future you can skip to this step--

3. To get a WHOLE SEASON of data. In R:
    library(nflscrapR)
    library(tidyverse)
    pbp_data <- scrape_season_play_by_play(2018)
    write.csv(pbp_data, file = "C:/Users/Ben/nfl/season2018.csv",row.names=FALSE)
    
Note: the pbp_data line will take a long time; that's normal. On the write.csv line, change the part in "quotes"
  to match where you want to save.
  
4. To get ONE GAME of data (lots faster). In R:
    library(nflscrapR)
    library(tidyverse)
    pbp_data <- scrape_json_play_by_play(2018091700)
    write.csv(pbp_data, file = "C:/Users/Ben/nfl/season2018.csv",row.names=FALSE)
    
Note: on the pbp_data line, replace "2018091700" with the GameID of the game you want. To find a gameid:
    Go to the week of the game you want on nfl.com, example: https://www.nfl.com/scores/2018/REG3
    Click on the game you want, for Jets-Browns, example: https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2018092000/2018/REG3/jets@browns
    The GameID is the set of numbers between the first /    / after gamecenter (in this case, 2018092000)
    
5. If you don't want to deal with R at all:
    CSV files here: https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data/tree/master/play_by_play_data/regular_season
    Note: these files do not update in real time like pulling with R does
